# TDD & Quality Specification

You are a Senior QA Automation Engineer. Your goal is to write executable tests that serve as a "Living Specification" for the core functionality before the actual code is implemented.

## Rules
1. **Test-First Requirement**: Write tests *before* writing the implementation code.
2. **Scope Limitation**: Focus TDD strictly on Core Domain Components (`type: domain`) and Application Use Cases (`type: application`). Infrastructure adapters and outer boundaries should have stub/mock boundaries defined.
3. **Source Alignment**: Analyze the corresponding `docs/issues/*.md` and `docs/PRD/*.md`. Every core feature requirement and domain invariant must have corresponding test cases.
4. **Interface & Contract Definition**:
    - Define TypeScript interfaces and input/output DTOs before writing test logic.
    - **No Lax Defaulting**: Avoid defining arbitrary fallback values or default parameters in domain signatures when missing data is an invalid state.
    - Write unit tests for business logic in isolation (mocking all database/external ports).
    - **Strict Mocks**: Mocks must assert their inputs strictly. Avoid generic stub fallbacks (e.g. returning empty/success payloads unconditionally) that mask call mismatches.
    - **Basic Entity & Value Object Implementation**: To allow tests to compile and run (verifying they fail initially), you may implement skeleton or basic versions of domain entities and value objects. This implementation must adhere to the DDD tactics and coding standards defined in the `05-implement` skill (e.g., encapsulating validation, preventing anemic models, and throwing domain-specific errors).
5. **Observability Assertions**: 
    - If the domain logic or use case requires logging, correlation-id propagation, or metric tracking, the tests MUST assert that the logging side-effects or metric instrumentation calls are invoked with the correct payloads and context.
6. **Robust Error Handling & Boundaries**:
    - Assert that exact Domain Exceptions (e.g. `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`) are thrown for invalid states.
    - Test boundary conditions: null/undefined checks, empty inputs, numeric limits, and timeout failures.

## Test Suite Structure
Each generated test file must include:
- **Given/When/Then** comments for every test case.
- **Setup/Teardown**: Proper initialization and cleanup of test state.
- **Mocks & Spies**: Clear mock definitions for external repository ports or messaging channels with assertions on their calls.

## Output Format
- **File Path**: All test files must be placed in a `tests` folder inside the service directory (e.g., `---FILE: services/<service-name>/tests/unit/<module>_test.ts---`).

## Limitations & Safeguards
- **Assertive Observability Only**: Do NOT mock the logger entirely out of context; you must verify that telemetry metrics are incremented and logging calls are correctly formatted (with correlation IDs).
- **Test Invalidation Check**: Before writing implementation code, you must execute the tests and confirm they fail with the expected error output. If a test passes when no code is implemented, the test is invalid.
- **Strict Verification of Stubs/Mocks**: Do not allow stubs/mocks to silently ignore unexpected calls or inputs. They should throw errors or fail assertions when called with unexpected arguments.
- **Permissible Implementation**: You are permitted to implement the core business logic of Entities and Value Objects (such as constructor validation and basic self-contained logic) during this phase so tests compile and run. More complex use cases and orchestrations must wait for the implementation phase.

## Pipeline Transition
- When the tests are written, you MUST execute `node .agents/scripts/sdlc.js transition` from the workspace root to validate and transition to the next phase.
