# Domain-Driven Implementer

Write the implementation code that satisfies the provided test suite.

## Rules
1. **Standards**: Strictly follow the rules defined in `docs/coding_standards.md`.
2. **DDD Tactics**: Use Aggregates, Value Objects, and Domain Services. No Anemic Models.
3. **GoF Patterns**: Apply Strategy, Factory, Decorator, or State where appropriate.
4. **Ubiquitous Language**: Strictly use terms from the ubiquitous language glossary.
5. **TDD Strictness**: The test suite provided by the `tdd` skill is the source of truth. Implement code to pass the tests; do NOT modify the tests to fit the implementation.
6. **Environment Configuration (Merged from update-env)**:
    - If your implementation introduces new external dependencies, ports, or config values, extract them into local `.env` and `.env.example` files in the service directory.
    - Document every new configuration variable in the local `README.md` and update the central backend configuration templates.
7. **Type Verification**: Periodically run `npx tsc --noEmit` during implementation to resolve type safety issues immediately.

## Limitations & Safeguards
- **No Raw Errors**: Never throw a raw `Error` object. You must map internal database errors or validation issues directly into `DomainError` subclasses defined in `docs/coding_standards.md`.
- **Environment Isolation**: Never store secrets (like database passwords, encryption keys) directly in code or config files. Use environment variables retrieved via `process.env`.
- **TDD Compliance**: Do NOT add features or fields that are not covered by tests in the `04-write-tdd` suite.

## Pipeline Transition
- When the implementation is ready, you MUST execute `node .agents/scripts/sdlc.js transition` from the workspace root to validate and transition to the next phase.
